# Smart SDN (Jarvis)
RL Framework for building smart SDN controllers

We build RL environments for effecient network traffic engineering using the openAI gym. We build environments 
for the following network functionalities:

1. Rate Control: 

   RL agent optimizes the amount of packets to allow and drop based on the network flow features.

   Usage: 
   
2. Routing: 

   RL agent optimizes the routing policy based on the network state.

3. Server Allocation during Network Fragmentation:

   RL agent optimizes the server allocation for various tasks in the face of network fragmentation and defragmentation.
